# EventScape

A lightweight web/mobile app that lets users discover upcoming local concerts in one place. Core classroom-friendly features:
Event Feed: Pull data from a public events API (e.g., Songkick, Ticketmaster) and list concerts with date, time, venue, and a “Learn More” link.


Search & Filter: Filter by date range or genre using simple JavaScript.


Map View: Embed Google Maps (or Leaflet) to plot venue locations.


Basic Favorites: Allow users to “star” events in localStorage so they can revisit shows they like.
